# üìö Detailed Agenda

Explore modular architecture in NestJS.
Learn to import/export modules.
Add Middleware, Pipes, and Guards overview.

- ValidationPipe: Creating a Task
- Error Handling: Getting a non-existing Task
- Error Handling: Deleting a non-existing Task
- Validation: Update Task Status
- Challenge: Validating Task Filtering and Search
  Implement a Logger middleware.
  Assignment: Modularize User and Auth modules.

- Services and Business Logic
